# Simple Calculator

This is a simple To Do Application in react.
In this application, I've used React components, React state, event handlers etc. using functional based components.
for calculation I have used mathjs library,https://mathjs.org/index.html

## The published Tic tac toe App:

https://ankitpatel-01.github.io/calculator-react-app

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
